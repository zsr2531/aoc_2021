# Advent of Code 2021

This repo contains my solutions to AoC 2021. I decided to use Rust exclusively this year, so all the solutions can be found in the same project.

## Usage

`./aoc_2021 <input1> <input2>`

> Note: If you want to solve part 1 first, you can omit `input2`.

Then the program will prompt you to select which day to load the solution for. Afterwards, it will read the input and feed it to the solution and then print the result.
